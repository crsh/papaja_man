# Future directions



## Contributions

Like `papaja` and want to contribute? Take a look at the [open issues](https://github.com/crsh/papaja/issues) if you need inspiration. Other than that, there are many output objects from analysis methods that we would like `apa_print()` to support. Any new S3 methods for this function are always appreciated (e.g., `factanal`, `fa`, `lavaan`).
