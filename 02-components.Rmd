# R Markdown components

Generally, R Markdown files consist of two parts.
The first is the YAML front matter that contains the documents meta information and rendering options.
It is located at the top of the R Markdown document.
The second part is the main body that contains R code chunks and prose in Markdown format.


## YAML front matter

[YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) is a human-readable and easy to write language to define data structures.


<!-- YAML data structures translate to (named) `list` objects<br />in R -->

<!-- ```{yaml} -->
<!-- --- -->
<!-- title: "YAML Example" -->
<!-- author: "Frederik Aust" -->
<!-- date: "29 11 2017" -->
<!-- output: html_document -->
<!-- --- -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- str( -->
<!--   list( -->
<!--     title = "YAML Example" -->
<!--     , author = "Frederik Aust" -->
<!--     , date = "29 11 2017" -->
<!--     , output = "html_document" -->
<!--   ) -->
<!-- ) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Indentations denote the structure of nested `list`s -->

<!-- ```{yaml} -->
<!-- --- -->
<!-- output: -->
<!--   html_document: -->
<!--     toc: yes -->
<!-- --- -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- str( -->
<!--   list( -->
<!--     output = list( -->
<!--       html_document = list( -->
<!--         toc = TRUE -->
<!--       ) -->
<!--     ) -->
<!--   ) -->
<!-- ) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Here, the `toc` is nested in `html_document`<br />(i.e., an argument to that output function) -->


<!-- Similarly, it is possible to specify vectors -->

<!-- ```{yaml} -->
<!-- --- -->
<!-- bibliography: ["references.bib", "r-package-references.bib"] -->
<!-- --- -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- str( -->
<!--   list(bibliography = c("references.bib", "r-package-references.bib")) -->
<!-- ) -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- --- -->
<!-- # `rmarkdown` -->

<!-- ### YAML front matter -->

<!-- Text that spans multiple lines can be declared with `|` -->

<!-- ```{yaml} -->
<!-- --- -->
<!-- abstract: | -->
<!--   This text spanns multiple rows. -->

<!--   New lines are preserved, but note the indentation! -->
<!-- --- -->
<!-- ``` -->


You don't need to familiarize yourself intimately with YAML to use R Markdown or `papaja` and I suggest you try to just use it.
The following is the default YAML front matter; it starts and ends with `---`:

```{r yaml-front-matter, results = 'asis', echo = FALSE}
yaml <- readLines(
  system.file(
    "rmarkdown", "templates", "apa6", "skeleton"
    , "skeleton.Rmd"
    , package = "papaja"
  )
)

cat(
    c(
      "```yaml"
      , yaml[which(yaml == "---")[1]:which(yaml == "---")[2]]
      , "```"
    )
  , sep = "\n"
)
```


### Manuscript metadata

Most of the information contained in the YAML front matter is information about the document.

| YAML field | Metadata |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|
| `author`  | list of author information (e.g., `name` and `affiliation`;<br />start each new author with `-`) |
| `affiliation` | list of institutional information (`id` and `institution`) |
| `authornote` | aka. acknowledgements; automatically contains corresponding author line |
| `keywords` | article keywords |
| `wordcount` | article word count |
| `note` | text to add above author note on the title page<br />(e.g. "Preprint submitted for publication") |


`title` is the full name of the manuscript that is printed on the title page and at the beginning of the introduction.
`shorttitle` is a short variant of the title and is printed in the running head on every page.

`author` is a structured list.
Each author's information is given in a separate element that is indented and starts with `-`.
A full `name` and an `affiliation` symbol need to be provided for every author.
The symbol is printed as superscript following the author's name on the manuscripts title page and can be a combination of multiple symbols if the author has multiple affiliations (e.g., `1,2` yields Ernst-August Doelle^1,2^).
Exactly one author has to be declared as corresponding author by adding `corresponding: yes` and the fields `address` and `email` to the author's information.
The latter two fields are used to automatically generate the last sentence of the author note that---as required by the APA guidelines---provides the corresponding author's contact information.
`role` is a list of contributorship roles that can be used to provide details on each authors contributions beyond the mere rank order of authors on the paper.
It is recommended that you specify roles from one of the established contributorship role taxonomies (e.g., [CRediT](https://casrai.org/credit/) or [CRO](https://github.com/data2health/contributor-role-ontology)).
Each author's list of roles is used to automatically generate a paragraph in the author note that lists each authors contributions.
Authors who contributed equally to the manuscript and share first authorship can be declared as such by setting `equal_contrib: yes`.
When equal contributions are declared a superscript is added to the author names and a corresponding explanation is added to the author note.

```{block2, tenzing-note, type = "rmdnote"}
For convenience, you can generate the YAML-code for the author-metadata with most of the above-mentioned information using the web application [*tenzing*](https://tenzing.club) [@holcombe_tenzing_2020].
Simply collect the metadata using the Excel or GoogleSheet template [provided](https://tenzing.club), upload it to [*tenzing*](https://tenzing.club) and copy the generated YAML into the front-matter of your document.
```

`affiliation` is another structured list that contains the institutions' information; again each new element is indented and starts with `-`.
`id` is printed as superscript in front of the `institution` name below the author names on the title page (e.g., `2` yields ^2^ Konstanz Business School).

`authornote` and `abstract` contain the text for the corresponding sections of the manuscript.
The `|` indicate that all following *indented* lines, including line breaks and new paragraphs, belong to this field.
Thus, `abstract` and `authornote` can be structured into multiple paragraphs as shown above.
`keywords` and `wordcount`[^wordcount] are self-explanatory and the corresponding information is printed below the abstract on the second page of the manuscript.

[^wordcount]: We hope to automate the word count in the future. For now, the current word count is printed to the R Markdown pane in RStudio or the console. See [Counting words] for details.

`bibliography` contains a list of one or more Bib(La)TeX files that contain the references cited in the manuscript.
Additional files can be added by appending them to the list separated by commata, e.g. `bibliography: ["my_bib1.bib", "my_bib2.bib"]`.
By default, `papaja` assumes that you will cite R and all R packages used for the analysis and that the corresponding bibliographic information is contained in `r-references.bib`.
See [Citations] for instructions on how to automate the citation of R packages.

`note` is an add additional metadata field that are not part of the default YAML front matter.
It's contents is printed on title page in between author information and the author note; it can be used to add remarks, such as "Preprint submitted to peer-review on June, 29th, 2016".


### Rendering options

The first set of rendering options breaks with the [guiding principal][Guiding principles] that `papaja` *is convertible* because they have no effect on Microsoft Word documents.
We decided to implement these options nonetheless because they are required by some journals and can be used for submissions where (initially) PDF/LaTeX documents are accepted.

| YAML field | Effect |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|
| `mask` | Omit identifying information from the title page |
| `appendix` | List of R Markdown files to include as appendices |
| `numbersections`           | Number sections headings |
| `disambiguate_authors` | Disambiguate author names in citations by adding given names |
| `annotate_references`  | Add annotation prefix to bibliography entries, e.g. `*` for meta-analytic references |
| `linenumbers`<sup>\*</sup> | Add line numbers in the margins |
| `draft`<sup>\*</sup> | Add "DRAFT" watermark to every page |
| `floatsintext`<sup>\*</sup>  | Place figures and tables in the text rather than at the end |
| `figurelist`<sup>\*</sup><br />`tablelist`<sup>\*</sup><br />`footnotelist`<sup>\*</sup> | Create lists of figure captions, table captions, or footnotes |
| `classoptions`<sup>\*</sup> | control the style of the document<br />(e.g., `man` or `doc`, see [`apa6`](https://mirror.hmc.edu/ctan/macros/latex/contrib/apa6/apa6.pdf) $\LaTeX$ class options) |

<small><sup>\*</sup> Only available for PDF documents</small>


`floatsintext` indicates whether figures and tables are to be positioned at the end of the document---as required by APA guidelines---or included in the body of the document.
If `figurelist`, `tablelist`, or `footnotelist` are set to `yes` lists of figure captions, table captions, or footnotes are created and placed after the reference section.
`linenumbers` indicates whether lines should be continuously numbered throughout the manuscript.
`draft` indicates whether a "DRAFT" watermark should be added to every page.
`classoptions` are pased to the underlying `apa6` $\LaTeX$ document class and define the layout and style of the manuscript.
For example, setting `classoptions` to `man` produces the default APA manuscript style, `doc` produces a more typical document (single-spaced, single-column).

The remaining rendering options affect both PDF and Microsoft Word documents.
`mask` can be set to `yes` to prepare the manuscript for double-blind peer review by removing author names, affiliations, and author note from the title page.
There are several additional options that are no not listed in the vanilla document template.
To add one or more appendices to the manuscript, a list of R Markdown files can be passed to `appendix`.
For details see [Appendices](#appendices).
`numbersections` controls whether section headers are numbered or not.
The remaining to options control formatting of citations and references.
As per APA style, citations in `papaja` documents will be disambiguated by adding given names if the bibliography file contains multiple authors with the same family but different given names.
This author name disambiguation can deactivated by setting `disambiguate_authors: no`, for details see [Author name disambiguation](#author-name-disambiguation).
When reporting meta-analyses, APA guidelines require that studies included in the meta analysis are included in the reference section and preceeded by an asterisk [p. 138, @american_psychological_association_publication_2010].
To do this, set `annotate_references: yes` and add `*` (or other indicators) to the `annote` field of the corresponding bibliography entries, for details see [Meta-analysis references](#meta-analysis-references).

<!-- The language of the manuscript is given in `lang` and affects automatically generated text, such as "Author note" on the title page or "Figure 1." in figure captions. -->
<!-- Currently, `english` and `german` are supported. -->

The `output` field determines the type of document that is created and can be either `papaja::apa6_pdf` or `papaja::apa6_word`.
Additional arguments can be passed to these functions, e.g. to delete the LaTeX source file after the PDF has been rendered (see `?apa6_pdf` for details):

```{yaml eval = FALSE}
output: 
  papaja::apa6_pdf:
    keep_tex: FALSE
```

- Extend `bookdown::pdf_document2()` and `bookdown::word_document2()`
    - Options of these functions should also work for `papaja` documents


#### Additional rendering options

Any additional rendering options supported by `rmarkdown::pdf_document()` or `rmarkdown::word_document()` can be added to the YAML front matter.
For example, a different citation style can be used by setting `csl` to the location of a [CSL](http://citationstyles.org/) style definition file.
For an overview refer see the list of [default variables](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#variables-set-by-pandoc), [language variables](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#language-variables), and [LaTeX variables](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#variables-for-latex) supported by `pandoc` and the [filter modes](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-citeproc/blob/master/man/pandoc-citeproc.1.md#filter-mode) supported by `pandoc-citeproc`.

`papaja` provides one additional rendering option that is not included in the default YAML header.
`replace_ampersands` indicates whether to replace `&` by `and` in all in-text citations as required by the APA citation style.
The option defaults to `yes` if no custom CSL file is specified but to `no` otherwise.
To replace ampersands in in-text citations with a custom CSL file add `replace_ampersands: yes` to the YAML front matter.


## Body

The body of R Markdown documents consists of prose written in Markdown interspersed with R code.

### Markdown

A general principle in typesetting is to separate content and style.
Separation is commonly achieved through the use of a markup language, which is a system of document annotations.
These annotations declare portions of text as, for example, title, section headings, or list items but, crucially, they are agnostic to what this means visually (e.g., `**text**` instead of **text**).
Separation of content and style is useful because it enables swift changes to an entire documents' style or structure and facilitates applying a common style across multiple documents.
Microsoft Word implements this strategy in their so-called *styles*, which are collections of formatting instructions that can be assigned to portions of the text.

`papaja` uses the [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax to separate content and style.
Markdown was desigend to be an easy-to-read and -write formatting syntax.
The key design goal was to create a syntax that is readable as-is.
The following is an excerpt from the APA example manuscript written in Markdown.

```{markdown}
# Methods
## Participants
Younger adults (14 women, 10 men, $M_{age} = 19.5$ years, age
range: 18–22 years) were recruited with flyers posted on the
Boston College campus. <!–– TODO: Add flyer to appendix! ––>

Older adults (15 women, nine men, $M_{age} = 76.1$ years, age
range: 68–84 years) were recruited through the Harvard
Cooperative on Aging (see Table 1, for demographics and test
scores).[^p]

[^p]: Analyses of covariance were conducted with these
covariates,with no resulting influences of these variables on
the pattern or magnitude of the results.
```

Without any prior knowledge of Markdown it should be easy to guess what most of this syntax does:
`#` and `##` denote first and second order section headings (and so on), `<!--` and `-->` surround comments that will not be displayed in the rendered document, and `[^p]` adds a reference to a footnote that is written out following `[^p]:`.
The equations surrounded by `$` may be somewhat less intuitive.
In R Markdown, equations are written in LaTeX's powerful [mathematics syntax](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics) (also see [Equations]).
For an overview of the Markdown syntax see [Markdown text formatting].


### R code

There are two ways to include R code in R Markdown documents.
The primary method is to use so-called *code chunks*.

    `r ''````{r, code-chunk, echo = FALSE}
    age_mean <- mean(demographics$age)
    ```

Code chunks are surrounded by ` `r ''```` ` and should be preceeded and followed by an empty line.
The behavior of code chunks can be controlled by passing comma-separated options surrounded by braces to the chunk.
The first option is compulsory and specifies what langauge the code chunk contains and usually be `r`, but other languages, such as `python`, `stan`, or `SQL` are supported.
[RStudio's knitr language engines documentation](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_knitr_engines.html) provides an overview of all supported languages.

The second option of a code chunk is its label or name, here `code-chunk`.
It is good practice to provide a meaningful name for each chunk because chunk names

1. briefly describe the following codes purpose and, hence, are a means of structuring and documenting the code
2. serve as meaningful names for graphic files that the chunks produce
3. are required to control when the code of a cached chunk has to be rerun because a preceeding chunk has changed (see [Caching expensive computations]).

By default, `papaja` sets the chunk options `echo = FALSE` and `message = FALSE` for all chunks.
`echo = FALSE` means that the code chunk is run but hides the code and `message = FALSE` hides any messages generated by the code so that they are not included in the manuscript.
Both settings can be overwritten if desired.
See the [knitr chunk options and package options](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/) for a overview of available settings.

R code can also be inserted into in a line of text, for example `` ``r ''`r mean(demographics$age)` ``.
Writing R code inline is a convenient way of reporting results of computations in the running text.
For example, the mean and standard deviation of participants' age are stored in variables named `age_mean` and `age_sd`.
These numbers can be reported by printing the variables in inline R code.

```{markdown}
Participants mean age was `r age_mean` years ($SD = `r age_sd`$).
```

As in any other R script, R code is executed from top to bottom.
Thus, any variables that are called in code chunks or inline R code must be defined above.

Reporting numerical values frequently requires some formatting, such as rounding or filling with trailing zeros (e.g., 24.10).
In the section [Numerical values], we provide an overview of `papaja` functions that can be used to easily format simple numbers or results from statistical analyses according to APA guidelines.
